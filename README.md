# Bike_Sales_Project
This mini-project is part of my Data Analytics certification journey with Entri Elevate, focusing on mastering key skills in data preprocessing and visualization to derive meaningful insights from raw datasets.

Phase 1 – Data Preprocessing (Microsoft Excel):
I performed comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and structuring to prepare the dataset for analysis. The resulting dataset is now well-organized and ready for the visualization phase.

Next Steps – Data Visualization (Power BI):
I will be using Power BI to design dynamic, interactive dashboards that effectively communicate data insights. This project aims to strengthen my practical knowledge in data preparation, analysis, and visualization using industry-relevant tools and methodologies.
